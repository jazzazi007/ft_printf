## üí° About the project

> _This project aims to recreate a simplified version of the `printf` function in C._

This project involves implementing a custom version of the `printf` function, which is commonly used in C programming for formatted output. The focus of this project is to understand and work with **variadic arguments**. The function will support several basic format specifiers like `%s`, `%d`, `%c`, and others, similar to the standard `printf` but without the extensive features.

For more detailed information, check the [**project subject**](https://github.com/Surfi89/42cursus/tree/main/Subject%20PDFs).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

This project is written in **C** and requires the **`gcc`** compiler for compilation. It uses only the standard **C libraries**.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```shell
$ make

### Customization Notes:
1. **Project Name**: The project name is already filled in as `ft_printf`.
2. **Tagline**: I added a brief description about recreating a simplified version of `printf`.
3. **Badges**: I updated the badge URLs to reflect your GitHub username (`jazzazi007`) and your repository name (`ft_printf`).
4. **About**: I have added the project description, focusing on implementing a simplified `printf`.
5. **Requirements**: The necessary tools are the GCC compiler and standard C libraries.
6. **Instructions**: The instructions detail how to compile and use the `ft_printf` function.
7. **Testing**: The testing section includes a link to the `printfTester` repository for testing your project.

This README now contains all the details for someone to understand and use your project, and it includes information on testing and using your custom `ft_printf` function.
